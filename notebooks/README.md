# 📓 Notebooks Directory

This directory contains Jupyter Notebooks used for exploring, analyzing, and modeling the solar radiation and environmental dataset collected from three countries.

Below is a brief description of each notebook:

## 📁 Notebook Descriptions

| Notebook Name |---------------------------|-------------| Description |
|---------------------------|-------------|

| `togo_eda.ipynb`          | Performs exploratory data analysis on Togo's dataset, including summary statistics, missing value inspection, outlier detection using     Z-scores, and basic data cleaning. It analyzes solar radiation trends over time, evaluates the impact of cleaning events, explores correlations, visualizes wind and temperature distributions, and exports a cleaned dataset to `data/togo_clean.csv`. |

| `benin_eda.ipynb`          | Performs exploratory data analysis on Benin's dataset, including summary statistics, missing value inspection, outlier detection using     Z-scores, and basic data cleaning. It analyzes solar radiation trends over time, evaluates the impact of cleaning events, explores correlations, visualizes wind and temperature distributions, and exports a cleaned dataset to `data/benin_clean.csv`. |

| `sierraleone_eda.ipynb`          | Performs exploratory data analysis on Sierraleone's dataset, including summary statistics, missing value inspection, outlier detection using     Z-scores, and basic data cleaning. It analyzes solar radiation trends over time, evaluates the impact of cleaning events, explores correlations, visualizes wind and temperature distributions, and exports a cleaned dataset to `data/sierraleone_clean.csv`. |
